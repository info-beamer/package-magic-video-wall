Configure a full video wall by just taking one picture
======================================================

Have a look at the demo video to get an idea of what
this video wall package is capable of:

Prerequisites
-------------

You can use any number of screens to create a video
wall of arbitrarily placed screens. Screens can be of
any size and you can rotate and place your screens
in any way you want.
If you're using Pi4 devices, you can connect two
screens to each Pi4. Otherwise with older Pis you'll
need one Pi per screen.

Content on your video wall can be images or videos.
Due to how videos are rendered, the resolution
of them should not exceed 720p. Higher resolutions
might result in slowed down playback. HEVC videos
are and will not be supported at all.

Experimental streaming supported is also available,
but results might vary. You'll probably get the best
result if you use a multicast stream and all
devices connected using Ethernet.

Set a playlist
--------------

After you imported this package into your account
you'll first have to create a setup based on it.
A setup allows you to create a video wall from
a collection of screens. If you want to create
multiple video walls, just create multiple setups.
In the setup you'll first have to click on the
**Assigned devices** tab and add all the screens
you want to use. Then click back to the **Configuration**
tab. 

Click on the node labeled **Playlist Configuration** on the
left side of the configuration screen.

You can add images and video assets to your playlist.
If you make changes to the playlist and click on **Save**, your
devices will have to resync for a short moment.

Configure the screens
---------------------

Let's configure the assigned screens. On the left
side, click the node labeled **Screen Configuration**.

You should see the screens you have assigned.
In case you didn't while setting up the playlist, click
on **Save** now.  This will instruct all assigned
devices to show a configuration tag. Each screen
should now show something like this:

![A configuration tag](config-tag.png)

The next step is to take a picture of all your screens
from the position of your future viewers.

_If you have a webcam available, you might skip to the
next section below!_

When configuring the video wall for the first time,
it's usually best to stand directly in front of all
your screens and take a picture. Make sure all
tags are visible.

Then click on **Upload/Capture Mapping Picture** and
select the picture you just created. Certain browsers,
especially on mobile devices, also allow you to directly
take a picture instead of selecting an existing picture.

After you've selected or taken a picture it might take
a moment to automatically detect all the tags in the picture.
If everything was successful, all screens items in
the configuration interface should turn green.
Just click on **Save** again and you're ready to show
content on your video wall.

If your snapshot didn't detect all tags or some
tags are covered, you can create more mapping
pictures to configure your wall. Be sure to capture
any additional snapshot from the same position you
took the initial snapshot. Otherwise your video wall
will look weird. Additional snapshots allows you to
create setups that include partially occluded screens:
First create a snapshot with all the screens in
the "bottom layer". Then, while keeping the camera
in the same position, add more screens on top and
create more snapshots to complete your setup.

Webcam Realtime Mapping
-----------------------

If your browser supports webcam access you can
instead use the Webcam Mapping mode. Just click on
the **Start Webcam Mapping** button. Your browser might
ask for permission to access the webcam. Allow this
access (Due to how the info-beamer configuration
interface works, the live video stream *never*
leaves your browser: All computation is done on your
machine and is never shared with info-beamer.com
or any other site), then point the webcam to your video
wall screens. You will see a preview window showing
all detected screens as they are added to your video
wall. If you want to see the current configuration on
your screens, just save the setup. Once you've mapped
all screens, you might click on **Stop Webcam Mapping**.

Changing the mapping
--------------------

If you're not satisfied with your configuration, just
click on **Reset mapping**. This will remove the previous
mapping configuration and allows you to create a new
one. Make sure you click on **Save** so all screens
show the configuration tags again.

Hints
-----

You can have screens in any orientation. They can be
rotated in almost any direction as long as the tag
is still detectable by the configuration system.
Be aware that a wierd arrangement might only look good
from the position you took the mapping picture.

If you want to create a video wall that works from
any angle, be sure that all screen surfaces are
planar.

Make sure you get as close to your screens as
possible as the video/image you show on your screens
will be scaled according to the mapping picture
you took. The further you're away from the screen,
the less of the content you'll see on them later.

I'd suggest you just play around with them a bit to
get a feeling of how the mapping system works.

Streaming
---------

This package as experimental support for live streaming.
Just enter a stream url and your device will play that
stream instead of the configured playlist.

Since there is no communication across devices running
a video wall setup, synchronization is tricky. Right now
streaming really only works if you configure a RTP multicast
stream. You can use the "Multicast Video Streamer" to
generate such a stream from a connected camera module.

Offline
-------

This package will not work offline as it requires a correct
system time across all devices using the package. Usually
that system time is provided online by querying NTP servers.
Without a correct time, the video wall will be desynced.

Release history
---------------

### Version 'dual'

This version now supports dual display configurations
on the Pi4. The configuration interface has been reworked
and setting up your video wall should be easier now.

### Version 'pi4'

Now compatible with the Pi4. In addition the way the 
"Camera Capture" feature is implemented has been updated
and should work with recent browser versions again.

### Version 'incremental'

The package now allows incremental mapping. This allows
you to configure partically occluded screens by taking
multiple configuration pictures from the same location.

### Version 'stream'

Added experimental streaming support

### Version 'webcam'

Added webcam support to the configuration interface.

### Version 'preview'

This is the first public release. While it works, there
might be problems. If you find anything, please open an
issue on [github](https://github.com/info-beamer/package-magic-video-wall/issues/new).
